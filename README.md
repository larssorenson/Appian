# Appian
The Appian project (named for Appian Way) is a Supply Chain, DevOps, and Engineering Systems enumeration and vulnerability analysis engine. All roads lead to Rome, after all.

By using directed graph analysis of assets, their relationships, and evaluating configurations or controls at each stage, Appian helps to automatically identify potential attack vectors in Supply Chains and DevOps/Engineering Systems.
This is similar to existing tools such as BloodHound.
